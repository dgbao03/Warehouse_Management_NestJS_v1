# Warehouse Management System

## Project Description

This project involves the development of a backend system to support warehouse operations. The system primarily focuses on:

- Managing goods within the warehouse.
- Handling the dispatching (Outgoing) of goods from the warehouse.
- User management and permissioning.

---

## Database Structure

The database is structured to support:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Secure access control through roles and permissions.
- **Product Management with Variants**: Products can have multiple SKUs based on different option-value combinations.
- **Export Management System**: Tracking and managing stock leaving the warehouse.

---

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: Primary programming language.
- **NestJS**: Framework for building scalable Node.js server-side applications.
- **TypeORM**: Manages database schema with migration support.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database.
- **BullMQ Queue**: Handles asynchronous/background tasks and prevents race conditions.
- **Redis**: Used with BullMQ for efficient queue management.
- **Nodemailer**: For sending email notifications using HTML templates.
- **JWT**: Authentication with access and refresh tokens.
